JS assignment

This application was created as part of an assignment. 
To try it out you will need to open the index.html file with Live server and be able to run the JavaScript file in the back. 
For example, open the two files with Visual Studio Code, right click on index.Html, and run with Live Server. If you can't see "Live server" option then you probably need to install the Live server extension. 

The purpose of this application is to earn money so you can buy a computer. You can earn money by "working". You work by clicking on the "work" button which will increment your payment amount by 100 kr for every click. The pay may be transferred to your bank balance and used for buying a computer. You also have the ability to make a loan. The loan must be repaid before you take a new one. 

Enjoy and have fun.
